Microsoft (MSFT) Q3 Earnings Call Segment:

Satya Nadella (CEO):
"We are seeing an acceleration in AI adoption across our entire tech stack. Azure AI revenue has grown by 50% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong demand for our OpenAI services. However, we are mindful of the increasing capital expenditures required to build out our data center infrastructure, which may impact short-term margins.

The PC market is showing signs of stabilization, but consumer spending remains softer than historical averages. We expect our Gaming division to see headwinds due to regulatory delays in certain markets, although the Activision Blizzard acquisition is now fully integrated and performing above expectations.

Overall, our cloud gross margins have improved slightly to 72%, and we remain confident in our long-term guidance of double-digit revenue growth."
